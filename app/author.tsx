            <Text>
                I&apos;ve always loved storytelling, and this book is my way of creating something new while learning new skills along the way—like writing, illustrating, and even understanding how to make and share a book. It&apos;s a journey into the world of creativity, marketing, and business that I&apos;ve always dreamed of exploring.

                This project is also deeply personal to me. Growing up, my father used to tell me stories about the forest and its wonderful creatures. Those stories are precious memories from my childhood, and even though I only remember a few of them, they&apos;ve inspired me to continue his legacy by writing new tales for a new generation.

                Through these stories, I hope to share the important lessons that I learned the hard way. I want kids to know that it&apos;s okay to ask for help, that friendship and kindness are priceless, and that it&apos;s perfectly normal to feel afraid sometimes. Most of all, I want them to understand that failure is just a part of learning and that being different is something to celebrate. Communication, honesty, and being true to who you are—those are the values I want to pass on through these stories.
